			"The Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) is designed to ensure the removal of present in waste water such as BOD, COD, TSS, AMMONIA, OIL & GREASE dissolved and suspended organic matter and many other contaminants which are generated from various industrial waste water processes.The environmental conditions are optimized in the ETP to encourage the growth of micro-organisms which consume these organic materials as their food for growth and mulplication which further help in providing water as per PCB norms. The ETP is also capable for removal of other contaminants present in waste water including suspended solids, nitrogen, phosphorous during various stages of treatment.",

			"Our main strength lies in our Research & Development, where our team of technicians are working to develop new products, so that the production time and energy can be optimised, without any hazards to the environment. We always ensure the quality of product supplied to the customer is up-to notch and thus regular quality test reports are generated.",
